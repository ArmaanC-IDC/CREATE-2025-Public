# Welcome to Think, Code, Create: Software Engineering with Python & AI

# This activity will go over the concepts you learned in lecture and 
# build your programming skills. If you have any questions or are stuck
# call us over and we'll help!

# Activity 1.1: Given a number, output if it is even or odd. 
# The code below collects data from the user and stores it in 
# the variable called x, which is then converted into an integer via the int() function.
# Instructions: 
# - For odd numbers, add a print statement saying that the number is odd. 
# - For even numbers, add a print statement saying that the number is even. 
# You can assume that the input is a valid integer number between 0 and 100. 
# Hint: look up the 'mod' operator. 


x = int(input("Please type in a number: "))


# Activity 1.2: The previous code only runs once and then terminates. 
# How can we make it run continuously? 
# Recall: What is something we discussed in lecture that allows you to repeat code?



# Activity 1.3: Turn the code into a function, so you can run the code selectively. 
# Recall: What is the keyword that defines a function? 



# Activity 1.4: Now we want to design a loop that terminates on its own. 
# Using a while loop, print numbers from 0 to 5. You may need to define a variable.




# Activity 1.5: How can we do this with a for loop instead of a while loop? 




# Activity 1.6: Design a counter that counts within a range that we specify. 
# For example, a counter that will count from 10 - 20.
# Hint: Function parameters and arguments? 




# Activity 1.7: Design a counter that counts within a custom range, but 
# only prints even numbers. Try to reuse as much of your existing 
# code as possible. 
# Hint: You can call a function within another function. 





# Activity 1.8: Storing data in your code. Design a function that outputs 
# the even and odd numbers within a given range, but all in one line like so: 
# [10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
# [11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
